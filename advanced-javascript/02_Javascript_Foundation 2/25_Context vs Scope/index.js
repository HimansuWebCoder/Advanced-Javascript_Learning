// Context vs Scope

// Scope is a function based thing
// Scope means what is the variable axis of a function when it is invoked?
// what is in the environment

// Context, on the other hand, is more about object based.
// Context says what's the value of the this keyword, which is a reference to the object that owns that
// current executing code.

// just keep in mind
// Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value
// of this keyword and scope refers to the visibility of variables.
