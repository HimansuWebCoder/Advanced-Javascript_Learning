// Have you heard of Babel or Typescript? They are heavily used in the Javascript ecosystem
// and you should now have a good idea of what they are:
// Babel is a javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS (older JS code).
// Typescript is a superset of javascript that compiles down to javascript.
// Both of these do exactly what compilers do: Take one language and convert into a different one!
